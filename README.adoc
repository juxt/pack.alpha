== Usage

=== Auto-add to project

Pack can add itself to your deps.edn automatically.
It will not modify your indentation style at all.
This is alpha, but so is everything else in this project.

It can be run at later times, in order to automatically bump the sha in your deps.edn.
It will continue to work even if you rename the default `:pack` alias to something else.

NOTE: This isn't infallible.  Please let me know if I break your indentation.

[source,clojure]
----
$ clojure -Sdeps '{:deps {pack/pack.alpha {:git/url "https://github.com/juxt/pack.alpha.git" :sha "dccf2134bcf03726a9465d2b9997c42e5cd91bff"}}}' -m mach.pack.alpha.inject '81b9e47d992b17aa3e3af1a47aed1f0287ebe9b8'
----

TIP: Latest stable sha is `81b9e47d992b17aa3e3af1a47aed1f0287ebe9b8`.

The following examples assume you have run this.

=== Lambda

The lambda approach will generate a zip which can be uploaded to AWS.

[source,bash]
.Example call
----
$ clj -A:pack mach.pack.alpha.aws-lambda -e classes lambda.zip
----

In this example:

* lambda.zip is where to write the package to.
* build_dir is a directory containing extra paths to add, for example it may be where you compile classes to, or write built css to.


[source]
----
Usage: clj -m mach.pack.alpha.aws-lambda [options] <path/to/output.zip>

Options:
  -A ALIASES               Concatenated aliases of any kind, ex: -A:dev:mem
  -R ALIASES               Concatenated resolve-deps aliases, ex: -R:bench:1.9
  -C ALIASES               Concatenated make-classpath aliases, ex: -C:dev
  -e, --extra-path STRING  Add directory to classpath for building. Same as :extra-paths
  -h, --help               show this help

output.zip is where to put the output zip. Leading directories will be created.
----

[TIP] 
====
Lambda (and by extension, lambada) requires java classes.
To generate these you will need to AOT your program.

Try this alias:

[source,clojure]
----
{:aot
 {:extra-paths ["classes"]
  :main-opts ["-e" "(compile,'example.lambda)"]}}
----

Then your build process will be like so:

[source,shell]
----
$ mkdir -p classes
$ clojure -A:aot
$ clojure -A:pack mach.pack.alpha.aws-lambda -C:aot lambda.zip
----

====

=== Uberjar

"Uberjar-ing" consists of packaging you application into one all-encompassing JAR (Java ARchive) file, called an "Uberjar", which can then be executed using `java -jar myapp.jar ARG1 ARG2 ARG3...`.

Pack provides several approaches for creating an Uberjar:

==== Capsule

This consists of building an Uberjar using http://www.capsule.io/[Parallel Universe's Capsule].

[source,clojure]
----
$ clj -A:pack mach.pack.alpha.capsule uberjar.jar -e build-dir --application-id mycoolapp --application-version "$(git describe)" -m myapp.main
$ java -jar uberjar.jar
----

[source]
----
Usage: clj -m mach.pack.alpha.capsule [options] <path/to/output.jar>
  -m, --main SYMBOL                           main namespace
      --application-id STRING                 globally unique name for application, used for caching
      --application-version STRING            unique version for this uberjar, used for caching
      --system-properties STRING              space-separated list of propName=value pairs, specifying JVM System Properties which will be passed to the application. Maps to the 'System-Properties' entry in the Capsule Manifest.
      --jvm-args STRING                       space-separated list of JVM argument that will be used to launch the application (e.g "-server -Xms200m -Xmx600m"). Maps to the 'JVM-Args' entry in the Capsule Manifest.
  -e, --extra-path STRING                     add directory to classpath for building
  -d, --deps STRING                 deps.edn  deps.edn file location
  -M, --manifest-entry STRING                 a "Key: Value" pair that will be appended to the Capsule Manifest; useful for conveying arbitrary Manifest entries to the Capsule Manifest. Can be repeated to supply several entries.
  -h, --help                                  show this help
----

The main *does not* need `:gen-class`, it follows the same semantics as clojure.main's `-m main`.
If main is not specified, it will default to `clojure.main`, meaning it can take options like `-m` or `-r`.
`extra-path` is useful for adding clojurescript & css to the resulting jar.
It can be used multiple times.

[CAUTION]
.Executing a Capsule JAR with JVM args / System Properties
====
As mentioned in the http://www.capsule.io/user-guide/#the-capsule-execution-process[Capsule docs], when you execute a Capsule-packaged Uberjar, 2 Java processes are actually run: the Capsule launcher, and your application process.

In particular, JVM args and System Properties passed to the `java` command will apply to both processes, which if you're not careful can result in waste of resources and collisions; for example:

* If you pass the `-Xms2g` JVM arg, you've just allocated 2 Gigabytes of unnecessary RAM for the Capsule launcher
* If you pass the `-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=7091` System Property you will get an error, as both Java processes try to use the `7091` port for JMX.

The way to prevent this is to pass special options that will only apply to the application process.
See the http://www.capsule.io/user-guide/#jvm-arguments-system-properties-environment-variables-and-agents[related Capsule documentation].
====

INFO: In the future I will extend Capsule support to include capsule-specific features, such as caplets and many of the related manifest attributes.

==== OneJAR

link:http://one-jar.sourceforge.net/[OneJAR] builder.
This is a suitable replacement for jdsoft JCL, without the GPL license.
It's especially practical where you can't extract into a `~/.capsule` directory, or don't need to bake in JVM args.

----
Usage: clj -m mach.pack.alpha.one-jar [options] <path/to/output.jar>

Options:
  -e, --extra-path STRING                add directory to classpath for building
  -d, --deps STRING        deps.edn      deps.edn file location
  -m, --main STRING        clojure.main  Override the default main of clojure.main. You MUST use AOT compilation with this.
  -h, --help                             show this help

output.jar is where to put the output uberjar. Leading directories will be created.

Example:

[source,bash]
----
$ clj -A:pack mach.pack.alpha.one-jar output.jar
$ java -jar output.jar

WARNING: This has been removed due to my own licensing concerns about co-locating the source with my own.

=== Skinny JAR

Output a classpath, or subset of it, into directories or jars.

[source]
----
Usage: clj -m mach.pack.alpha.skinny [options]

Options:
      --no-libs                            Skip lib outputs
      --no-project                         Skip project outputs
      --lib-dir PATH       target/lib      Where to place the output libraries
      --lib-type STRING    :jar            Lib type format to use, keep or jar. Keep will keep in original format (jar or dir)
      --project-path PATH  target/app.jar  Where to place the project output, if it ends with .jar then the project will automatically output as a jar also.
  -A ALIASES                               Concatenated aliases of any kind, ex: -A:dev:mem
  -R ALIASES                               Concatenated resolve-deps aliases, ex: -R:bench:1.9
  -C ALIASES                               Concatenated make-classpath aliases, ex: -C:dev
  -e, --extra-path STRING                  Add directory to classpath for building. Same as :extra-paths
  -h, --help                               show this help
----

.Put the entire classpath into jars and run from the filesystem
====

[source,shell]
$ clj -A:pack mach.pack.alpha.skinny
$ java -cp "target/app.jar:target/lib/*" clojure.main

====

.Output only project files into a single jar
====

[source,shell]
$ clj -A:pack mach.pack.alpha.skinny --no-libs

====

==== Uploading to Clojars (or Maven)

Using skinny jars, pack can be used to upload artifacts to Clojars.
This example should be easily modified to work with Maven repositories too, but I haven't tried.
A full example can be found at link:https://github.com/SevereOverfl0w/super-duper-octo-barnacle[super-duper-octo-barnacle].

. Follow link:https://github.com/clojars/clojars-web/wiki/Pushing#maven[Clojars maven guide] for "settings.xml" only 

. You can generate your jar by passing the `--no-libs` option to your jar.
Also in this example is `--project-path`, although this is not strictly required.
I highly recommend putting this in a Makefile or shell script.

----

. You will also need a pom.xml, you can generate one with `clojure`:
+
[source,bash]
----
clojure -Spom
----
. Update the pom.xml as necessary to correct your groupId or version.
Future calls to `pom.xml` won't change them back.
. Use `mvn` command line to deploy

[source,bash]
----
mvn deploy:deploy-file -Dfile=my-cool-lib.jar -DrepositoryId=clojars -Durl=https://clojars.org/repo -DpomFile=pom.xml

=== Docker image

Create a Docker image via link:https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib[Jib]. Supports building to local Docker daemon (`--image-type docker`), tarball (`--image-type tar`) and uploading to Docker registries authenticated via `$USER_HOME/.docker/config.json` (`--image-type registry`).
